# Truth Seekers

## Search Goggle for Non-Mainstream News and Opinions

Goggles are simple, self-contained text files which can be hosted in Github or
Gitlab. These files contain instructions allowing you to tell Brave Search how
you'd like your results to be ranked. You can target specific URL patterns
(and, soon, website titles and other aspects of Web pages) and indicate how
their ranking should be altered (e.g. boosted, downranked, or completely
discarded from the results).
